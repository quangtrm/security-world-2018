## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- **Vietnam remains a major target for APT groups**, particularly in government, finance, and telecom sectors.
- **Traditional security measures (AV, Firewall, IPS/IDS) are insufficient** against sophisticated APT campaigns.
- **APT actors use advanced techniques** such as phishing, PowerShell-based backdoors, privilege escalation via Mimikatz, and stealthy tunneling.
- **Organizations must adopt a proactive security approach** with **Threat Intelligence, advanced endpoint security, and 24/7 SOC operations**.

## 🛡 Defense Strategies
- **Email security and web filtering** to prevent phishing-based initial access.
- **Endpoint monitoring (EDR, SIEM) and behavioral analytics** to detect privilege escalation.
- **Network segmentation and anomaly detection** to block lateral movement.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions** to monitor and prevent data exfiltration.
